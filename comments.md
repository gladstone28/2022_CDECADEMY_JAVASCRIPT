Programming is often highly collaborative. In addition, our own code can quickly become difficult to understand when we return to it— sometimes only an hour later! For these reasons, it’s often useful to leave notes in our code for other developers or ourselves.

Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for developers using the code, or add any other useful annotations.
